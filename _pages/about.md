My research encompasses two key aspects: 1) exploring sequence-function relationships of enzymes using high-throughput approaches for protein characterization and 2) leveraging machine learning to develop quantifiable models for enzyme stability and activity. By combining these approaches, I aim to understand the sequence-function relationships of enzymes in greater depth, unraveling the intricacies that govern their behavior and performance. This deeper understanding will not only expand our knowledge of enzyme functionality but also pave the way for the creation of highly optimized and tailored enzymes for a wide range of applications.
